Overview:

Objective: Predict hourly solar power generation using plant sensor data (temperature, humidity, power readings).

Data Processing: Merging data on nearest timestamps, cleaning missing values, outlier removal, and normalization for deep learning inputs.

Feature Engineering: Created time-based features (hour, minute) alongside environmental variables to capture seasonal and cyclical effects.

Modeling:

Implemented LSTM and GRU architectures with TensorFlow-Keras for sequential data modeling.

Used early stopping and careful train-test partitioning to ensure generalizable results.

Evaluated models using MSE and MAE; best model achieved test MAE of 0.009â€“0.15 on unseen data.

Visualization: Performed exploratory analysis (pairplot, boxplots, 3D scatter plots) and visualized loss curves over training epochs.

Outcomes: Produced accurate forecasts of solar power; insights inform operational decision-making and sustainability efforts.

Tech Stack: Python, pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Project Highlights:

Robust real-world data cleaning and integration techniques

Modern deep learning methods for time series forecasting

Visualization and interpretability for stakeholders
